# BlueFire Platform
In the event of a wildfire or other natural disasters we help civilians and public authorities best communicate the necessary information - even without cell tower communications - in order to save more lives.

# How it works:
Users are able to see their current location with respect to firefighters, medical aid, and shelters.
Using Bluetooth technology and mesh networking we are able to inform the community of how to best react in this situation. Firebase is our backend database that keeps track of all the events and personnel on ground.

We were able to access Workday's Pulse Point historical data, however for this implementation we focused on the current user's experience.
